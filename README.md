# 587_Project

ECE 587 project, creating a CAD tool to integrate antiquated Excel sheets into a homogenous system.

This project serves the purpose of taking basic information formatted in Excel, and using this infromation to generate useful results. In particular, electrical disribtion is considered, where the inputs are the individual circuit elements from a CAD drawing. These values are entered into a standard Excel template, which is a sheet within the Excel file. This sheet template can be duplicated any number of times to include as many panels as necessary. The other two sheets in the Excel file are blank templates for the transformer and feeder schedules. Information for these schedule is automatically generated by the script, and entered into the sheets.

## File Structure
scripts:
main.py - handles script execution

panels.py - contains classes for panels, transformers, and a directed graph

datahandler.py - handles interacting with the Excel documents

/excel_sheets - directory containing an example project 'floor1.xlsx', and the results of the script execution 'results.xlsx'

/rating_information - directory containing information on transformer sizing as well as wire gauge sizing based on amperage
